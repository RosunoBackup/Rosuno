# rosuno-guard v4 (P2-920; v3 from P2-919): merge-boundary check posted as the required status "rosuno-guard".
# Reads Git objects only; executes nothing from the PR. The trusted runner supplies every input.
#
# Usage: rosuno-guard.sh <base> <head> <head-branch> <approved-ref>
#   <base>          current owner `main` tip, fetched directly by the trusted runner (never PR metadata)
#   <head>          PR head commit
#   <head-branch>   PR head branch, wi/<ID>[-slug]
#   <approved-ref>  tip of the OWNER repository's branch with the same name. Only the owner can push there,
#                   so a byte-identical Packet proves the Packet is the owner-adopted one (revisions are
#                   ordinary forward-only owner commits on that branch).
#
# Rules (UOM v2.0 §§5, 9, 14 / C1 rev6.0 §C1.3):
#   R0  up to date: <base> is an ancestor of <head>, so the checked net diff is exactly what lands on main.
#   R1  branch is wi/<ID>[-slug].
#   R2  docs/work-items/<ID>/PACKET.md at head is byte-identical to the owner-approved Packet; header fields
#       exactly once, WORK_ITEM/BRANCH bound to the branch. BASE_SHA is provenance only. A Packet already on main
#       (merged work item) authorizes in-scope corrections when unchanged or when the head carries the owner's
#       revision from the owner branch (v4); the net diff is still judged against its scope.
#   R3  every path in the net diff base..head is inside ALLOWED_SCOPE and outside FORBIDDEN_SCOPE (FORBIDDEN wins,
#       case-insensitive); PROCESS-only control paths need TYPE: PROCESS; regular files only; no private
#       authority, submodule or credential files; other work-item Packets only as literal carried records.
#   R4  migrations on main are immutable; new ones need `MIGRATIONS: new allowed`, a canonical name and a
#       timestamp after every migration on main, and may not be registered as applied before merge.
#   R5  no new case-insensitive path collision or case-only alias against main.
#   R6  no commit in base..head contains a credential-like or private-authority path (public history is permanent).
# History shape is not restricted: integration merges of main are normal; the net diff decides.
